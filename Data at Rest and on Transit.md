HOW TO SECURE DATA AT REST AND ON TRANSIT ON AWS?

Here is what i just recently did;



#The #Situation:

In a previous project, I was responsible for architecting the cloud infrastructure for a financial services company that required the highest level of security for their data. The company stored sensitive client information on AWS, and it was critical that we ensured data security both at rest and during transmission to comply with financial industry regulations like PCI-DSS.



#My #Task:

My task was to design and implement a security solution that ensured data was encrypted at rest in storage and during transmission across networks. We had to guarantee that no unauthorized parties could access the data, and we needed to ensure compliance with industry regulations, maintaining encryption standards without impacting performance.



#Action:

1. Securing Data at Rest:

  - I enabled AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to manage encryption keys and applied server-side encryption (SSE) for data stored in services like S3, RDS, and EBS.

  - For S3 buckets, I used SSE-S3, which encrypts objects using 256-bit AES keys. In the case of more sensitive data, I applied SSE-KMS, providing additional control over encryption keys.

  - For databases like RDS and EBS volumes, I ensured that encryption was enabled during the creation of instances using KMS keys.

  - I also enforced encryption of backup snapshots.



2. Securing Data in Transit:

  - I enabled TLS (Transport Layer Security) for all communication between clients and AWS services to protect data in transit.

  - I enforced HTTPS by configuring S3 bucket policies and enabling SSL for all applications accessing S3.

  - For internal communication between AWS services, I utilized VPC endpoints to ensure private, secure communication between services like S3 and EC2 within the VPC.

  - To enhance security further, I implemented AWS Shield and WAF to protect against potential man-in-the-middle attacks during data transmission.



3. Auditing and Monitoring:

  - I enabled AWS CloudTrail to log and monitor API activity and access to encryption keys.

  - I also used AWS Config to continuously evaluate whether encryption policies were being enforced and AWS GuardDuty to detect any unauthorized access attempts or anomalies.



#End #Result:

By implementing these encryption methods and security best practices, we ensured that the company’s sensitive client data was fully protected both at rest and in transit. We passed all security audits and maintained compliance with the PCI-DSS regulations. The solution also minimized any performance overhead, which was critical to the client’s operations. This helped build trust with the client and improved the overall security posture of the organization.
